# Lab Experiments:

# PART A
## Implement the following in NS2/NS3:

1.	Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.
2.	Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.
3.	Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source / destination.
4.	Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets.
5.	Implement and study the performance of GSM on NS2/NS3 (Using MAC layer) or equivalent environment.
6.	Implement and study the performance of CDMA on NS2/NS3 (Using stack called Call net) or equivalent environment.

# PART B
## Implement the following in Java:

7.	Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).
8.	Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using bellman-ford algorithm.
9.	Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server program to make the client send the file name and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present.
10.	Write a program on datagram socket for client/server to display the messages on client side, typed at the server side.
11.	Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.
12.	Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm.
